This is an empirical analysis of 13 countries (1993-2018) with different levels of Inflation rate 
in order to get insights of how much this affects the growth of the economy using Stata.

This study aims to answer the relationship between inflation and economic growth 
and try to identify the main channel through which inflation impedes economic growth and the gaps for further research.

My sample consists of 13 countries and 26 years. 
Australia, The Bahamas, Belarus, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary,  Iceland, Jordan, Japan, Jamaica, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland 
The selected years are fluctuated from 1993 to 2018.

The statistical important variables in my model are Inflation and Taxes.
The only positive but weak relationship between Economic Growth and Inflation was detected when Inflation rate is ranged between 0-3 percent ( t = 0.79 ).
The strongest negative relationship between Economic Growth and Inflation was detected when Inflation rate is ranged upper 15 percent   ( t = - 4.74 ).

For the different levels of inflation, I found that critical variables such as 
General Government Debt, General Government Final Consumption Expenditure, Gross Fixed Capital Formation, Growth of Labor Force 
affect the growth of economy by changing the positive (negative) relationship they had in a negative (positive) relationship. 
Î‘lthough, in most cases these variables are not statistically significant.

After the IV test, I came up to the conclusion that inflation is an endogenous variable in the model, therefore, 
there is causality relationship between the Economic Growth and Inflation.
